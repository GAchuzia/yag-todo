# Yet Another Generic Todo App

The *YAG* Todo app is a simple implementation of a todo app made using the Flask Library and a SQLite database.

## Challenge

This project is for an assignment from the SYSC3010 (Computer Systems Development Project) course at Carleton University, wherein students can write/record a tutorial not covered in labs or lectures.

I'm hoping I can give a concise overview on how to get started building applications using Flask and SQLite, two technologies I just began to familiarize myself with (we can learn together!).

## Tutorial

Feel free to scan through the markdown tutorial [here](), or download the [pdf version]().
