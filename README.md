# Yet Another Generic Todo App

![Picture of the YAG-todo app with some tasks](media/yag-todo-app.png)
A simple implementation of a todo app made using the Flask Library and a SQLite database.

## The Challenge

An assignment from the Computer Systems Development Project (SYSC3010) course at Carleton University, wherein students can make a tutorial on a topic not covered in lectures/labs.

I (try to) give a quick introduction to Flask and SQLite by building a todoapp, two technologies fairly new to me.

## Tutorial
