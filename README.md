# Yet Another Generic Todo App
The *YAG* Todo app is a simple implementation of a todo app made using the Flask Library and a SQLite database.

## Introduction
This project is an assignment from the SYSC3010 (Computer Systems Development Project) course at Carleton University, wherein students can write/record a tutorial not covered in labs or lectures. 

I'm hoping I can give a concise overview on how to get started building applications using Flask and SQLite, two technologies I just began to familiarize myself with (we can learn together!).

## Tutorial
Feel free to scan through the markdown tutorial [here](), or download the [pdf version]().
