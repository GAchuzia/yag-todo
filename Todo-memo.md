### Introduction

Throughout this tutorial, we will learn the basics of the Python Flask library and the database engine SQLite by building a simple todo app. I find that the easiest way to learn certain programming concepts/tools is through making stuff!

### Prequisites
I'm going to assume you are familiar and comfortable programming in Python, SQL, HTML and CSS. The main goal of this project is to learn new tools (Flask and SQLite) with pre-established programming fundamentals.

### Setting Up Your Environment

In a directory of your choosing, make a project folder called `todo-app`, and create a Python virtual environment within that project folder where you can type the command `pip install Flask`.

```python
(venv) C:directory/of/your/choosing/todo-app pip install Flask 
```
The rest of our project will be written within this venv, so don't deactivate it!
